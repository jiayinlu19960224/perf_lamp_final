My final project for a really fun course, Harvard GSD course SCI 6338, Introduction to Computational Design: https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/course/introduction-to-computational-design-fall-2019/, taught by Professor Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo Lopez: https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/jose-luis-garcia-del-castillo-lopez/.

Sorry, this documentation was crammed out overnight. If you found any errors, or have questions using the code, please don't hesitate to contact me at jiayinlu19960224@gmail.com. 
I will keep updating and improving the code and documentation, if people actually use it!
